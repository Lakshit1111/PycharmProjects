Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have real-time access to specific company reports or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the annual report of Exide Industry for 2020 or any specific details from it. However, I can provide you with a general summary of the industry growth and challenges, as well as an overview of the auditors' report.

The battery industry, in which Exide Industry operates, experienced both growth and challenges in 2020. The increasing demand for batteries in various sectors, including automotive, industrial, and renewable energy, contributed to the overall growth of the industry. The rising adoption of electric vehicles and the need for energy storage solutions also played a significant role in driving the industry forward.

However, the industry also faced several challenges in 2020. One of the major challenges was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted global supply chains and caused a decline in demand for certain battery applications. The lockdown measures and economic uncertainties resulted in a temporary slowdown in production and sales for many battery manufacturers, including Exide Industry.

Additionally, the industry faced challenges related to environmental regulations and sustainability. As the focus on reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to cleaner energy sources intensified, battery manufacturers had to adapt to stricter environmental standards and invest in research and development to develop more sustainable and efficient battery technologies.

Regarding the auditors' report, without access to the specific report, it is not possible to provide details on any negative aspects mentioned in the report. However, auditors' reports typically highlight any significant issues or concerns identified during the audit process. These may include financial irregularities, internal control weaknesses, or non-compliance with accounting standards or regulations.

It is important to review the auditors' report in detail to understand any negative aspects mentioned and their potential impact on Exide Industry's financial performance and operations. This report provides valuable insights for stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and management, to assess the company's financial health and governance practices.

In conclusion, the battery industry experienced growth and challenges in 2020, driven by increasing demand and technological advancements. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental regulations posed significant challenges for battery manufacturers like Exide Industry. To understand any negative aspects specific to Exide Industry, it is necessary to refer to the auditors' report for the year 2020.
